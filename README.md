### This project uses React, CSS, Bootstrap and Iconify.
### It passes all the users test included in the CDN below which I have included in my index.html folder: 
    <script src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js"></script>

When viewing the project on GitHub Pages you will need to manually select '25+5 clock' in the drop down menu so it's the right set of tests being run and this allows to verify I've passed all the users tests (29/29). 

### This project uses Hooks and function components as I personally prefer them and they are the more modern way of using React. Also this code is relatively basic and doesn't have the need for Error Boundaries for example. The version of React used is 17.0.2.
